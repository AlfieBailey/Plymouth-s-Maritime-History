  <p>Welcome to the introduction page, about the past and present of Plymouth's maritime sector. Plymouth is widely referred to as Britain's Ocean City, <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GScDs1aWwAE7fz0.jpg:large" style="width: 20%" id="plym">
    and even on the signs when you're entering the city, you'll see this reference on those. The reason for this widely renowned nickname, is due to the fact that it's got a maritime history that runs deep, is one of Britain's premier
    cities for the maritime sector to this day, 
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/PHOTEXOF_HMS_ST_ALBANS_MOD_45161945.jpg" style="width:50%" id="hp">
    as well as the location making the nickname make sense, as Plymouth lies just where the English Channel broadens into the open Atlantic, with unbroken water west to North America. Plymouth is also home to the biggest dockyard in
    Western Europe (although Portsmouth residents will disagree), and home to several ships, as specified on the <a href="index.html">HMNB Devonport</a> page. As previously stated, Plymouth has a very rich maritime hsitory dating back to as early as the 1200s,
    with major events occurring in most centuries between then and now. 2 of the most famous people from Plymouth are in relation to Plymouth's maritime sector, those 2 being <a href="about.html">Sir Francis Drake</a> and <a href="hawkins.html">Sir John Hawkins</a>.
    In Drake's instance, he's known as a bit of a hero in Plymouth, with there being several buildings, and even an island, named after him. Hawkins, however, isn't quite heralded the same way Drake is. He was a very important and well known figure, but his achievements for the most part aren't
    viewed as on the same level as Francis Drake. As for the present, the maritime sector is still making its contributions, as can be seen if you look at the <a href="factfile.html">'Maritime Facts'</a> page. There are plenty of tourist attractions
    that date back to events in the past, or are situated in their respective locations, ingrained in Plymouth's maritime history. Almost all of these are coastal, although scattered around different parts of the city's coastal areas. To summarise this all, there is plenty
    of things to know in regards to Plymouth's maritime sector, and in a lot more detail than this brief introduction. Hopefully after reading the pages, you are more informed about the sector, and how crucial it has been to the country as a whole, as well as Plymouth,
    whether that's half a millenium ago, or in the modern day.
